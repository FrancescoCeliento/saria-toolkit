**sariaâ€‘toolkit** is a Java library designed to 
simplify and accelerate application development by providing a complete set of tools, helpers, converters, and various functions.
 Designed to integrate easily into any project, it 
can be included through a simple dependency (Maven, Gradle, or local JAR),  without requiring complex configurations. Thanks to a  modular structure and well-documented architecture, developers  can quickly access reusable components for common operations,
 data conversions and support logic, thus reducing the 
time spent writing code. The library is constantly updated: new features, optimisations and fixes are released regularly, ensuring compatibility with
 the latest versions of Java and maintaining high standards of quality and reliability.
